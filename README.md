## Add the bongo cat to your stream
A nice little bongo cat themed drum machine.  
Be warned: This is a work in progress.
### What does it do?
Bongo Cat for Twitch lets the popular meme cat appear on your screen whenever someone in your Twitch chat issues a command.
### How do i add it to my stream? (easy route, START HERE)
 * Add a new browser source and point it to https://jvpeek.de/ext/bc/#yourchannel
 * Set the size of the browser to 1920x1080 pixels.
Done.

### How do i install it locally? (advanced users)
If you want to modify the sounds or the behavior you can also run it locally.

 * Point your OBS browser source to the index.html file and add your channel name as a hash.

For Example:
http://localhost/twitch-bongocat/#jvpeek

 * Set the size of the browser to 1920x1080 pixels.

### How do i use it?
There are two commands:  
 * `!bpm`
Lets you choose the speed of the song.
 * `!bongo [notes]`
Plays back the sounds in chunks.
Notes are divided into chunks by spaces. `12 34` would result in two chunks.
The first one containing notes `1` and `2`, the second one containing `3` and `4`.
### What instruments are available?
As of now, there are the same instruments as on https://bongo.cat.
### Can i modify this?
Yes. And please show us the results.
